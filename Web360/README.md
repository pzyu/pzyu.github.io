panorama-viewer
===============

A 360° photo viewer, made using THREE.js and pure JavaScript.

About
-----
This is a simple JS script depicting a web app which shows 360° photos like Facebook.
Opening this on your smartphone's browser allows you to view the image by tilting
your phone, as if it were a camera!
You can also use the arrow keys or the mouse on your desktop browser to move the image.

Third-party
-----------
I do not own THREE.js. THREE.js's minimal distribution, which is included on this repo,
has its own license, which can be found on the THREEJS-LICENSE file.

The file "img.jpg" was found on Texturify (https://texturify.com), so give those awesome guys a hug.
